 Well, l am a 57 year female awaiting authorization for Dr Gray to preform back surgery.  He is very confident In all questions I have ask, as far as explaining them to me in a way I can understand. This diffently has given me peace. He has had no holds barred as far as helping me to know,  surgery and recovery won't be a walk in the park and I love his truthfulness. Dr Gray has a very good sense of humor that I need to help me remember hes on my side. His staff  are very intentive to my needs and they always return my calls.
